## Hello 🌏, I'm Nick

I recently earned a B.S. in Computer Engineering and am continuing to explore the world of programming while I look for work. My interests are diverse and include embedded systems, programming languages, databases, networking, mixed reality, computer vision, machine learning & artificial intelligence. I'm passionate about game systems, both analog and digital, and enjoy studying how rulesets contribute to human interaction. Generally, I enjoy building systems that incentivize positive human experiences be that through games or communicating new ideas.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on designing a strategy game and practicing functional programming paradigms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go and Unreal Engine.
