## Hello 🌏, I'm Nick

Since graduating from the University of Washington I’m continuing to pursue my hardware/software interests and working to develop skills that will help in designing new systems. While looking for work daily I'm continuing to explore the world of programming and all it has to offer. My interests are diverse and include embedded systems, programming languages, databases, networking, computer vision, mixed reality, machine learning & artificial intelligence. I'm passionate about game systems, both analog and digital, and enjoy studying how rulesets contribute to human interaction. Generally, I enjoy building systems that incentivize positive human experiences be that through games or communicating new ideas.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on designing a strategy game and practicing functional programming paradigms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go and Unreal Engine.
